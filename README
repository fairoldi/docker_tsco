DOCKER COMPOSE FOR TSCO 
=======================
This projects allow to instantiante a complete TSCO 11.3.01 environment
using docker and docker-COMPOSE.

It uses defaults for almost everyhing (ports, db users, passwords)
The only exception is the OS user to run the software: the 'bmc'
account is used for all tools.

The .env file allows to customize hostnames and domain for the components,
However it is mainly used to pass information to the installers.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
 * docker (this was developed on 18.06)
 * docker-compose 
 * AT LEAST 7GB of available RAM
This also works on windows as long as you install docker for windows
(which already includes docker-compose)

HOW TO USE
----------
 1) Obtain tarballs for all components, and place them in the appropriate 
    directories. The structure should be as follows:

        docker_tsco
        |- tsco 
        |   \- TSCO_AppServer_ver11.3.01_Linux.tar.gz
        |- tsps 
        |   \- TrueSight_Presentation_Server_11.3.01_Linux.tar.gz
        |- tsso 
        |   \- Remedy_Single_Sign-On_for_TrueSight_Version_11.3.01_Linux.tar.gz
        \- db

    Keep in mind that if the files you download have different names, you will 
    have to edit the relative Dockerfile and install.sh scripts accordingly.
 2) edit the .env file only if you need to modify hostnames or domain
 3) run 'docker-compose up' from this directory
 3) wait 5 to 10 minutes
 4) everything should be up and running

NOTES:
------
 * unless you prune the containers, the install scripts do not reinstall 
   components it they find them on the filesystems. This means that
   your install will persist reboots and that running 'docker-compose up'
   will be a lot faster

KNOWN ISSUES:
-------------
 * you can't run this twice on the same host, as ports exposed by containers 
   will clash
 * CHFs are not automatically downloaded and applied
 * TSCO is not automatically registered on TSPS
